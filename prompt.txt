/ralph-loop:ralph-loop " Read the instructions at plans/LOOP.md , another loops reported that everything is done so your work will be to verify story by story and task by task that indeed everything is already
                          implemented, and if you find any gaps between the implementation, the user stores, the knowledge base or the requirements file PRD.md  you implement/fix it, mark any pending task as finished
                          once you verify that indeed everything is properly implemented for it, run tests and linters to make sure the code is correct, Keep a journal about it, so if we hit a limit a next loop can continue where you left off,
